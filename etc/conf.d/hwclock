# Set CLOCK to "UTC" if your Hardware Clock is set to UTC (also known as
# Greenwich Mean Time).  If that clock is set to the local time, then
# set CLOCK to "local".  Note that if you dual boot with Windows, then
# you should set it to "local".
clock="local"

# If you want the hwclock script to set the system time (software clock)
# to match the current hardware clock during bootup, leave this
# commented out.
# However, you can set this to "NO" if you are running a modern kernel
# and using NTP to synchronize your system clock.

# If you do not want to set the hardware clock to the current system
# time (software clock) during shutdown, set this to no.

# If you wish to pass any other arguments to hwclock during bootup,
# you may do so here. Alpha users may wish to use --arc or --srm here.
